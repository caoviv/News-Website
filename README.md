# LESSON 6 : MODERN HTML AND CSS ASSIGNMENT
## FLEX YOUR SKILLS!
## ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION

Two parts: 

    Go to flexboxfroggy.com and make your way through as many levels as you can
    Make a fake webpage for your favourite magazine or news platform. Use HTML5 semantic elements and adjust the layout of them using CSS flexbox.


## INSTRUCTIONS

Continuing on from Lesson 6, make your way through as many Flexbox Froggy levels as you can. Then to further practice your new skills, apply flexbox to some of the new semantic elements you’ve learnt.

Choose what your small webpage is going to be about. Is it a mini fashion magazine? Snippets of hard hitting news? A quick climate change journal? 

Now that you’ve got a bit of an aesthetic in mind, set up a new index.html file with a supporting style.css sheet. You can duplicate your folder setup from last week and remove everything between the &lt;body&gt; tags in the HTML & all your styling from your CSS or you can continue to edit and build on your code. Up to you!

In your HTML page, code in the following elements:
    header
    1- 2 nav(s)
    1-3 sections
    3 - 5 articles
    footer

Put some of your fake news content within your semantic elements. Use heading tags, paragraphs, image tags, lists and links etc. Hint: borrow from your favourite website or put in sample images and Lorem Ipsum to fill it out. 

Now that you’ve got the foundations of your news page set up, create some new layouts using Flexbox. Try at least 3 variations of flexbox layouts. You could...
    Layout and space your navigational links using flexbox
    Create a different flexbox layout for your articles
    Set up a flexbox layout for the sections on your page

Have fun with it!

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

    Understand and practice using semantic elements instead of foundational HTML
    Play with Flexbox Froggy to familiarise yourself with flexbox behaviours

    Style various flexbox layouts on your semantic elements to utilise both concepts together and become competent in the different flexbox properties we learnt:
    flex-direction
    flex-wrap
    justify-content
    align-items
    align-content
